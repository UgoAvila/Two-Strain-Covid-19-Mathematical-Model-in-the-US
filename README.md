# Two-Strain-Covid-19-Mathematical-Model-in-the-US


Code to obtain the figures for the main text and the supplementary material for the article called "Modeling COVID-19 dynamic using a two-strain model with vaccination".

The main file "Mathematical_Model_Two_Variant" will obtain all the figures. But to obtain the partial derivatives of the control reproduction number for the wild-type or original, alpha and delta variant use the Mathematica codes "Sensitivity Analysis R0 original Strain", "Sensitivity Analysis R0 UK strain" and "Sensitivity Analysis R0 delta strain" respectively.

For any questions regarding this code, do not hesitate and send an email to ugo.avila.ponce@gmail.com
